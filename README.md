# HowToAttributeCredit

This is the GitHub repo for my MPhil in Financial Technology dissertation, entitled "How to attribute credit if you must".

There are three folders, namely:
1. Figures, containing all named figures from the thesis document.
2. Code, containing Python code (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) for Scopus scraping and data processing.
3. Data, containing processed data from Excel, as well as the Gephi network files.
